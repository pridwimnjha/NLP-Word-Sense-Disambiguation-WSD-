# NLP Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)**, an important task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that determines the correct meaning of a word based on its context. For example, the word *“bank”* may refer to a *financial institution* or a *riverbank*, depending on surrounding words.

The notebook implements and demonstrates various **NLP techniques and machine learning methods** for performing WSD.

## 🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
* Implementation of **Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms**.
* Use of **WordNet** and **NLTK** for lexical and semantic analysis.
* Machine learning-based classification for predicting correct word sense.
* Performance evaluation using standard NLP metrics.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NLTK** (WordNet, tokenizers, lemmatizers)
* **Scikit-learn** (ML models & evaluation)
* **Pandas, NumPy** (data handling)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (visualization)
